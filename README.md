Gameplay Mechanics

The goal is to navigate all your pieces from the start to the center of the board before your opponents.

Starting the Game
Each player rolls the dice. The highest roller begins, and the game continues clockwise.
Rolling a six gives you another turn and is also required to move a piece out of the starting area.
Moving Pieces https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.smaitsoftware.ludo_master&hl=en&gl=US
Pieces move clockwise around the board according to the number rolled.
Landing on an opponent's piece sends it back to their starting area.
Safe spots and shortcuts can be used to your advantage.
